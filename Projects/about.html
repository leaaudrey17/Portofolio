                        <p>In 2015, Lea Audrey—then a digital artist—struggled to find a community that truly understood the challenges of digital creation. This inspired her to envision a platform where artists could connect, grow, and share their work.</p>
                        <p>By 2018, she gathered a small team to build what would become Picverse. Starting as a simple portfolio site, it quickly evolved into a global creative hub.</p>
                        <p>Now as CEO, Lea leads Picverse with a clear mission: to empower digital artists through connection, inspiration, and community.</p>
